Project for Mobile Apps Module 2016

### Description

This is an app I made from my project. It is a simple app that allows users to get their current location using GPS services.
Then you're able to save that location and access all your stored locations in another page in the app.

### Functionality

Functionality used in the app: Gps, file storage and retrival and localization.

Used Gps to get the location, location details are stored in a file which are then retrieved from the file.
I added German and French resource files to demonstrate localization in the app.
